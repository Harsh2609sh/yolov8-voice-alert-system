# YOLOv8 Voice Alert System

This project uses YOLOv8 and OpenCV to detect objects in real time using a webcam.
When a new object appears, the system announces it using voice alerts.

The goal of this project is to improve real-time awareness using computer vision.

## Features
- Real-time object detection
- Voice alert for new objects
- Avoids repeated announcements
- Groups multiple objects in one message
- Uses webcam input

## Technologies Used
- Python
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- OpenCV
- Windows Text-to-Speech (SAPI)

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Run the program:
   python main.py

Press `q` to exit.
